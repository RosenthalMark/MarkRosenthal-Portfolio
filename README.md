# Hi, I am Mark Rosenthal

QA Automation Architect with 9 years of experience building fast, stable, and scalable test systems across web, mobile, and API platforms. I design automation that removes release risk and accelerates engineering teams.

---

## What I Do

- Build complete QA ecosystems that are automated, documented, and CI CD integrated  
- Engineer end to end test frameworks for UI, mobile, and API platforms  
- Design quality gates and release validation systems for high velocity teams  
- Lead shift left initiatives and embed quality earlier in development  
- Build internal AI driven tooling for faster and more stable automation  

---

## Automation and Tooling

I design and maintain large scale automation systems using modern, battle tested tooling across the full testing pyramid.

**UI and Mobile Automation**
- Cypress  
- Playwright  
- Appium  
- Selenium  

**API and Integration Testing**
- Postman  
- Runscope  
- Custom Node and Python harnesses  

**Load and Performance Testing**
- K6  

**Supporting Tooling**
- GitHub Actions  
- Jenkins  
- Docker based preview environments  

These tools are used together to create stable, versioned, and self validating automation pipelines that run continuously in CI.

## Test Suite Architecture and Quality Systems

I specialize in building large scale, production grade test suites that reflect real user behavior and protect critical revenue paths.

- Designed and maintained test suites with 300 plus automated checks per platform  
- Built full critical flow coverage across authentication, payments, subscriptions, and content delivery  
- Created layered smoke, regression, and release certification suites  
- Implemented deterministic test ID strategies to eliminate selector flakiness  
- Built rollup reporting for engineering, product, and release management  

**Test Management and Reporting Platforms**
- TestRail  
- Xray  
- Runscope  
- Custom CI reporting dashboards  

These systems are designed to provide fast signal, traceability to requirements, and confident release decisions.

## Engineering Leadership and Teaching

I operate as both a hands on architect and an engineering leader focused on long term quality culture.

- Built a full Cypress curriculum from scratch used to onboard and level up engineers  
- Led QA Guilds for over 5 years across multiple teams  
- Led Shift Left Guild initiatives for over 5 years focused on early validation and developer owned quality  
- Mentored engineers in test design, CI strategy, and framework architecture  
- Partnered with product and engineering leadership on release risk strategy  

My leadership focus is building systems and people that scale together.

## Core Skills

**Automation:** Cypress, Playwright, Appium, Selenium, K6, Postman  
**Languages:** JavaScript, TypeScript, Python  
**CI CD:** GitHub Actions, Jenkins, CircleCI  
**Cloud:** AWS, GCP, containerized preview environments  
**AI Tooling:** BuildGhost, Ghost Ops, DOM mapping, auto tagging, AI test generation  
**Platforms:** Web, mobile, OTT (Apple TV, Roku, Firestick)  

---

## Highlights

- Built and scaled automation for a large live streaming platform with millions of users  
- Designed a release autonomy framework that reduced manual QA and stabilized deployments  
- Implemented a unified test ID strategy that eliminated selector flakiness across teams  
- Founded and led QA Guilds and Shift Left Guilds for over 5 years  
- Developed internal AI utilities for DOM harvesting, test scaffolding, and automatic tagging  

---

## Projects

### BuildGhost.dev  
Internal AI powered QA utilities focused on DOM mapping, test generation, and selector stability.

### Ghost Ops  
A DOM patch engine that stabilizes selectors and reduces long term test flakiness.

## Portfolio Website  
*Coming Soon*

My portfolio site is being built from scratch as a fully interactive experience that includes:

- A video demo theater showcasing real automation systems  
- A Rolodex style skill card system  
- Each skill card dynamically expands into real world usage, tooling, and architecture examples  
- End to end walkthroughs of how frameworks, CI systems, and test strategies were built and used  

The goal is to present not just tools, but the exact systems and decisions behind them.
