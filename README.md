# Hi, I'm Mark — QA Engineer & Automation Architect

I build automation systems that help teams ship faster without sacrificing quality.

With 9+ years of experience designing and scaling QA architectures across web, mobile, and API platforms, I specialize in Cypress, Playwright, and CI/CD automation with a focus on reliability, maintainability, and measurable business impact. I am deeply passionate about bringing stability to fast-moving development environments through modern, data-driven QA practices.

## What I Do

- Build complete QA ecosystems that are automated, documented, and fully CI/CD-integrated  
- Engineer end-to-end test frameworks for UI, API, and mobile platforms  
- Integrate QA into release pipelines with versioning, quality gates, and traceability  
- Mentor engineers and teams to scale quality with confidence and autonomy

## Why I Build

Automation is more than a tool to me, it is a catalyst for **developer confidence, release velocity, and product trust**. My goal is always the same: make quality **measurable, predictable, and fast**.
